# Solar-Installations

This project organises a csv file from NYS for their solar projects. The file that I have coded is DataProcessor.scala
The dataset this organises is from https://data.ny.gov/Energy-Environment/Solar-Electric-Programs-Reported-by-NYSERDA-Beginn/3x8r-34rs.
Specifically the Feburary 6, 2023 dataset.
